# Activity Tracker
An application that keep's track of user activity. 

## Interface Workings
After the user has entered, Date of Activity, Activity Type, Start Time & End Time, Distance Range and has clicked the submit button. The information is generated into a table format underneath the form. You will notice that each input information is underneath a heading. The user is able to sort various activities by clicking each heading. The user is also able to delete non preferred table row.

## Behind the interface 
I used Bootstrap to make the interface look really nice and mostly because my main mission was the functionality using JavaScript. 

### HTML
The HTML is very simple I just have a form and a table underneath so when the user submits the form their input is generated into the table.

### CSS
There is very little CSS because my main mission was the functionality using JavaScript.
